# **Zero Hunger Management System**

## **Project Overview**

The **Zero Hunger Management System** is an application designed to combat food waste and hunger by connecting food donors (hotels, individuals) with NGOs and needy people. This system allows users to register their leftover food, which can then be redistributed to those in need through an automated matching system.

## **Key Features**

- **User Registration & Login:**
  - Different roles (hotel, NGO, and individual) can register on the platform.
  - Secure login and password management for all users.

- **Food Donation Registration:**
  - Donors (hotels/individuals) can register their leftover food with details such as food type, quantity, and availability.

- **Recipient Registration:**
  - NGOs and needy individuals can sign up to receive food donations.

- **Food Matching System:**
  - The system automatically matches available food with the registered recipients based on location and other factors.

- **Admin Interface:**
  - Admins can manage user data, oversee food donation requests, and track the redistribution process.

- **Real-Time Notifications:**
  - Notifications are sent to both donors and recipients regarding food donations and status updates.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java Swing:** For building the graphical user interface (GUI) to provide an interactive experience for users.
- **MySQL Database:** For storing user data (donors, recipients, and admin details), food details, and donation records.
- **SQL Queries:** To handle the registration and tracking of food donations and manage user actions.
